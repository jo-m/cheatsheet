# My personal keyboard cheatsheet
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jo-m/cheatsheet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jo-m/cheatsheet)
Contains shortcuts for several applications I commonly use. Don't expect it to contain all the shortcuts, because I only put in the ones I usually forget.

Design inspired by the [CLion Reference Card](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/clion/docs/CLion_ReferenceCard.pdf) from JetBrains.
